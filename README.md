- 👋 Hi, I’m @phantom-duck
- 👀 I’m broadly interested in algorithms, mathematical optimisation, game theory, logic, programming language theory, and all that is needed to implement them.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning (or trying to learn) about learning in games, with some category theory in my spare time.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything fun, to be frank!
